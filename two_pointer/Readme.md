# Sliding Window & Two-Pointer Problems in C++

This repository contains a curated collection of **classic sliding window and two-pointer problems** from LeetCode, solved in **C++**.  

For each problem, you will find:
- A **problem description** at the top of the file  
- A **brute force solution** (O(n¬≤) or worse, to illustrate baseline thinking)  
- An **optimized sliding window / two-pointer solution** (O(n))  
- A small **`main()` driver** for quick testing  

This repo is intended as both a **learning lab** and a **reference library** for sliding window patterns.
